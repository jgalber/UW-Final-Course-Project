# Lesson 10 Assignment - Course Project â€“ FINAL 

Name of the website: **Travel Advisor** 

URL: https://confident-johnson-6cc96d.netlify.app/ 

# Summary 

This application consists of five pages with full content, covered with all kinds of backgrounds and background-colors with no blank spaces. They all work efficiently at different breakpoints and viewport sizes. One feature to point out is the navigation bar, where the popular 'hamburger' menu has been implemented to display when the breakpoint occurs. As a result, the entire application is fully responsive. In addition, the headings, images, paragraphs, links, buttons are animated to provide more interactivity to the user. The theme of the project itself is related to travel. 

* The first page is, obviously, Home. This page serves as a landing page for users. At first glance, the background image dominates the entire page, plus a 'star animation effect' has been attached to the background to provide some animation. Another highlight of this page is the navigation bar, which was designed exclusively for this page, to make it easier for users to navigate through other pages of the website. 

* The second page, following the alphabetical order printed in the navigation bar of the home page, is About.  Here the content debuted within a main section and a sidebar. The section contains three articles, and each article talks about the services that the company provides. On the left, the sidebar, where the testimonials or recent user reviews are located. 

* The third page is called Advisors (formerly known as Destinations), and this is the page where the APIs are located. Due to this fact, I ran into many problems when implementing the APIs that had been specified in the proposal. After many hours of researching, testing the program and the API functionality to get the expected result, nothing happened. So, I made the decision to get rid of them and use an API that would specifically generate an image, a title, and the email address of each Advisor. And the second API is just a list of countries that will be displayed by clicking the animated button below the gif file. To get to that point, I had to search for free available APIs by improvising a close approach for this project. 

* Blog is just a blog page. The purpose of this page is dedicated to three Spanish cities where my cultural heritage is related to them. 

* The fifth and final page is Contact, which consists of a form that shares the same background image as the home page, but this time it has a blur effect. 

To conclude, the footer is the only component that was included in the entire app, but the "terms and conditions" link is under construction and redirects to the contact page by default, as well as the social media icons which only have amazing hover effects. 

I hope you like this page. Thanks for stopping by here.
