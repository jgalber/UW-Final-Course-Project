This is the final for the Front End Developer Course

# Lesson 10 Assignment - Course Project â€“ FINAL 

Name of the website: **Travel Advisor** 

URL: https://confident-johnson-6cc96d.netlify.app/ 

# Summary 

This application consists of five pages with full content, covered with all kinds of backgrounds and background-colors with no blank spaces. They all work efficiently at different breakpoints and viewport sizes. One feature to point out is the navigation bar, where the popular 'hamburger' menu has been implemented to display when the breakpoint occurs. As a result, the entire application is fully responsive. In addition, the headings, images, paragraphs, links, buttons are animated to provide more interactivity to the user. The theme of the project itself is related to travel. 

* The first page is, obviously, Home. This page serves as a landing page for users. At first glance, the background image dominates the entire page, plus a 'star animation effect' has been attached to the background to provide some animation. Another highlight of this page is the navigation bar, which was designed exclusively for this page, to make it easier for users to navigate through other pages of the website. 

* The second page, following the alphabetical order printed in the navigation bar of the home page, is About.  Here the content debuted within a main section and a sidebar. The section contains three articles, and each article talks about the services that the company provides. On the left, the sidebar, where the testimonials or recent user reviews are located. 

* The third page is called Advisors (formerly known as Destinations), and this is the page where the APIs are located. Due to this fact, I ran into many problems when implementing the APIs that had been specified in the proposal. After many hours of researching, testing the program and the API functionality to get the expected result, nothing happened. So, I made the decision to get rid of them and use an API that would specifically generate an image, a title, and the email address of each Advisor. And the second API is just a list of countries that will be displayed by clicking the animated button below the gif file. To get to that point, I had to search for free available APIs by improvising a close approach for this project. 

* Blog is just a blog page. The purpose of this page is dedicated to three Spanish cities where my cultural heritage is related to them. 

* The fifth and final page is Contact, which consists of a form that shares the same background image as the home page, but this time it has a blur effect. 

To conclude, the footer is the only component that was included in the entire app, but the "terms and conditions" link is under construction and redirects to the contact page by default, as well as the social media icons which only have amazing hover effects. 

I hope you like this page. Thanks for stopping by here. 

# SEO 

Search engine optimization is a huge field to cover in a single lesson. In other words, it is a powerful tool that is constantly evolving in different aspects on the net and websites globally. It is the area that Google takes advantage (or uses) to control the content of a website. However, the content itself plays a crucial game on SEO environment. Depending on the quality of the content, which must be relevant, of a website, the browser will parse the data and then decide how to rank your page in the search engine; the result might appear at the top or may not even be displayed.  

There are many SEO techniques to apply according to the needs of each project, some are familiar, and others are not. In my brief experience as a web developer, Metadata, semantic elements duly used in HTML markup, a11y (accessibility) to provide a more user-friendly inclusiveness and a better positioning of web pages to all types of users.  

After testing my website through the Lighthouse tool. I found that the percentage values and information reflected in the development tools makes clear the purpose of creating strong websites that conform to some established standards or rules, such as performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO. 

Tricks: 

* Choosing a good title could catch the attention of the user and reach a larger audience in a business environment.  

* The headings, from h1 to h6, should be used properly. 

* Keywords must match with the content of the page and try to find out what keywords are commonly used. 

* Then, in the last stage, some extra rules such as internal links, readability, accessibility and ARIA labels, and images. 

To categorize SEOs Techniques: 

* On-page SEO are basically all I have mentioned earlier, metadata, keywords, images, texts. All the information that Google needs to position your website.  

* Off-page SEO is related to backend strategies that I would love to learn more about. 

To conclude, I realized that dealing with writing semantic HTML is basically more important than I expected. The other languages will flow and meet during the development process.
